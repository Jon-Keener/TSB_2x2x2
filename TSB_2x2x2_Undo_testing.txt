20221114 undo_turn development and testing with the 2x2x2 board and code...

  all undo tests have worked so far: 100, 200, 201, 202
    there were problems for 100 and other things though...

  what about regular scoring?











20221111 undo_turn testing with the 2x2x2 board and code...

  undo of 2-letter UP word:

  The initial test put a 2-letter word back in the rack and removed the
  moves from game_record.  However, the second letter played is now
  un-playable and stuck on the rack.

  --> inspect(p1rack): ['t0', '.', 'd0', 'a2', 'a1', '.']

  The p1rack was not updated as part of the undo_turn.
  Reviewed code... added the tile to the racks as part of undoPiece().
  This fixed things for a 2-letter UP word @ [0,2,4]...


  undo of 2-letter DW word:

  --> scores the word instead of calling undo_turn()...


  undo of 2-letter DO word:

  --> crashes in checkWords(), so again
      scores the word instead of calling undo_turn()...

      Added switch( yx_dir ) to checkWords()
        UP, DW and DO words are processed differently

      --> UP 2-letter word undo_turn works
      --> DW 2-letter word undo_turn works
      --> DO 2-letter word undo_turn works

      --> Checked-In and promoting to TSB, 20221111.
